                            so i have a confession to make my resume
                            was really bad for a really long time
                            and if you are anything like me you
                            might have picked the first resume
                            template from google copy pasted some
                            big words from your friend's resume and
                            made something that barely represented
                            you and i never thought about it until i
                            saw my friend's resume that was being
                            shortlisted everywhere i realized how
                            bad my resume was i'll tell you what i
                            changed in my resume to create the
                            perfect resume for myself that got me
                            interviews in amazon and google off
                            campus highlights your profile it's not
                            like that you'll change your resume
                            today and suddenly tomorrow all the
                            recruiters will start calling you the
                            goal of this video is to create the best
                            possible resume that highlights your
